# LazyFoo SDL2 Tutorials

This repo represents a complete refresh and restart of everything I know about SDL2 game programming. 

I will be going through from the ground up and doing all the tutorials from scratch for as long as it takes and progress will be recorded here. 

All credit and kudos to [Lazy Foo' Productions](www.lazyfoo.net)

## Dependencies

This code requires SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_mixer at various points of the tutorial.
